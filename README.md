# GraphLibrary

All popular graph algorithms implemented in C++ 11. Graphs are represented as adjacency lists with an additional set for edges to ensure constant runtimes for the existence query of an edge.

The implemented algorithms are:
* Breadth-first search
* Depth-first search
* Topological sort
* Jarnik-Prim minimum spanning tree
* Kruskal minimum spanning tree
* Bellmanâ€“Ford shortest paths
* Dijkstra shortest paths
* Johnson shortest paths
* Ford-Fulkerson maximal flow
